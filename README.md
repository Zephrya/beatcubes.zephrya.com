# Welcome to the [BeatCubes](https://beatcubes.zephrya.com/) website repository



## Getting started

Zephrya does **not** provide support for running the BeatCubes website locally. Therefore, you'll have to seek help from third parties. This also means that any support tickets regarding hosting the website locally or tickets requesting support for local hosting will be marked as Resolved or removed.

TL;DR: It is not recommended to run the BeatCubes website locally as there is simply no need to.
